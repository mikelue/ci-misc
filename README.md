[aws](maven/)

Scripts for AWS

`aws-ecr-get-login.sh` - [Logs-in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/ECR_AWSCLI.html) to [AWS ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/what-is-ecr.html) by environments:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - should be put in **keeper of secret values** of CI services
- `AWS_REGION`

This script removes `-e none` arguments to make `docker login` working for newer version.

Example:
```bash
# 1. Sets-up environment variables
# 2. Following code execute the output of aws-ecr-get-login.sh
$(aws-ecr-get-login.sh)
```

If the running context has `aws` command, this script uses it directly.
Otherwise, this script uses docker image [mikesir87/aws-cli](https://hub.docker.com/r/mikesir87/aws-cli) to run aws command
if the context has [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) installed.
